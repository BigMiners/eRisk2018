Early risk prediction on the Internet

eRisk explores the evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics and practical applications (particularly those related to health and safety) of early risk detection on the Internet.

The system presented here has been developped for the first task:

Task 1 - Early Detection of Signs of Depression : the challenge consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence (Social Media entries) and detect early traces of depression as soon as possible.
